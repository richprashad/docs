## Overview

Flow is a lightweight (i.e., not a full replacement) email client for processing, replying to, and composing emails.

We don’t yet recommend Flow as a full replacement for Gmail, Outlook, Superhuman, or your other email clients. 

We'll get there with a major improvement in Q4 2025; however, even with that improvement, we’ll still only have the core functionality of an email client and not a complete replacement. 

Our hope is that Intelligent Inbox will provide sufficient value through briefings, suggestions, AI Drafts (coming soon), and AI labels, enabling Flow to meet most of your email needs.

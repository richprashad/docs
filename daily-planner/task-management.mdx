## Overview

In Tasks, you have your daily Kanban to organize your to-dos.

You can open task cards to manage descriptions, subtasks, tags, set whether it’s repeating, make notes, and see linked events and emails. 

You can drag emails and calendar events to create tasks that are linked to those items.

## Overview

Knowledge workers need every advantage to stay focused rather than messing around with updating a bunch of screens and fields (slowing them down, adding cognitive load).

Assistant is your chat- and voice-based copilot that can answer questions and take action using natural language.

Assistant can create events, tasks, time-blocks, summarize your day, and much more.

What makes the assistant special is that, within the conversation, Flow provides interactive tiles for the relevant tasks and events to make your workflow smoother.

We know that trust is the foundation of Flow. Your data, emails, and tasks are highly sensitive, and protecting them is one of our top priorities.

Flow is [**CASA Tier 2**](https://appdefensealliance.dev/casa)** certified**, which means it has been independently reviewed and certified for meeting industry-leading standards in security and compliance.

### How we keep your data safe:

- **Encryption at rest and in transit** – All data is encrypted using TLS 1.2+ during transfer and strong AES-256 encryption when stored.
- **Zero data resale** – Your data is never sold, shared, or used for advertising. Flow only processes data to provide you with your assistant experience.
- **OAuth-based authentication** – We use Google and Microsoft’s secure OAuth 2.0 protocols for connecting your accounts, so Flow never sees or stores your passwords.
- **Minimum permissions** – Flow requests the minimum necessary permissions to function. You stay in control of what accounts are connected.
- **Independent annual audits** – CASA certification means Flow undergoes independent security and compliance audits to ensure ongoing adherence to best practices.

### Your privacy, your control

At any time, you can disconnect your accounts from Flow in **Settings**. This instantly revokes Flow’s access. You also have full control over the data stored in your account and can request its deletion at any time by emailing us at [hello@enterflow.co](mailto:hello@enterflow.co).

We believe security should be invisible but uncompromising. 

That’s why we’ve designed Flow so you can stay focused knowing your information is protected to the highest standards.

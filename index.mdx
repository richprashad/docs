## Overview

Flow is your intelligent productivity assistant.

Your combined executive assistant, daily planner, and defense against distracting emails.

Every detail in Flow is meticulously crafted to protect your focus.

Before we get into the details, let's pause to explain who Flow is for and who it's not.

<Accordion title="Who is Flow designed for?" defaultOpen icon="pen-paintbrush">
  Flow is meant for already productive knowledge workers but who are wasting time, their scarcest resource, on \$20/hour tasks.

  Tasks like email and calendar management and organizing their priorities.

  Mindless work they suspect AI is well suited to do for them so they can focus on their higher impact priorities.

  Flow is for people who take their productivity game seriously and are looking for a better system for filtering out the distracting emails and labelling the actionable ones, brief them a few times a day with summary digests, and organize their tasks and calendar together.

  They likely already practice calendar time-blocking to protect their deep work.

  That said, they've hit the point of diminishing returns on their investment into efficiency (they're already organized high-output people) and are now more focused on their effectiveness (prioritizing the right things in the right order to maximize outcomes).

  They need fewer distractions and better time management and delegation workflows.

  Their current personal productivity stack isn't designed for effectiveness and/or they've cobbled together multiple tools that don't properly integrate and collectively cost more than they should.

  If this sounds like you, please keep reading.

  If not, we'd recommend getting started with Todoist, Things, or the other beautifully designed personal task management tools to become more organized.

  While Flow does task management, these other tools will be more affordable to get started on.

  We'll be here waiting for you when we're a better fit.

Now that you have a better sense of whether Flow is for you, let's get back into the details.

## Flow has three modules designed to maximize your flow state

Flow's modules are Intelligent Inbox, Planner, and Assistant.

Each of these modules has a section in the Settings to manage your personal preferences.

On the left of the image above, you'll see which features are helping to filter the incoming chaos in your email inbox and on the right which ones are helping you get into and keep you in flow state.

Our goal with Flow isn't to have the most features; it's to have the most intelligence baked into each feature so Flow feels like magic right out of the box.

Below are links to dive into each module.

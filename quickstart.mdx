## Get started in three steps

Get your accounts connected, your preferences set, and turn on your Intelligent Inbox.

### Step 1: Connect your Google and Outlook accounts

**Connect your primary email account**

The email account (either Google or Outlook) that you use to subscribe to Flow on Stripe becomes your primary.

We recommend that you use your personal Google or Outlook account as your primary, so that if you change jobs in the future, it's easy to disconnect your old work email and connect your new work email as a secondary account.

You only pay once for your primary account and can have as many secondary accounts as you'd like at no additional cost.

**Connect any secondary email accounts**

To add more secondary accounts, you can do so in the Settings (gear icon on the bottom left) \> General \> Linked Accounts.

Click the "+ Link account" button and follow the Google or Outlook.

### Step 2: Set your preferences

**Set your Inbox preferences**

Go to Settings \> Inbox and select the inboxes you want to display in the Inbox module.

Also, set your default for composing new emails.

**Set your Calendar preferences**

Go to Settings \> Calendar and select the calendars to display, event default, and time blocking default.

You can also set the color of your calendars using the overflow menu on the dropdown.

**Set your Time Blocking preferences**

Go to Settings \> Time Blocking and select your default availability, visibility, and event duration.

If co-workers have access to view your calendar, we recommend setting your visibility as Private so they won't be able to see the names of your time blocked tasks on your calendar but will still be able to see the rest of your normal events as usual.

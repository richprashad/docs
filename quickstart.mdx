## Get started in three steps

Get your accounts connected, your preferences set, and turn on your Intelligent Inbox. 

### Step 1: Connect your Google and Outlook accounts

**Connect your primary email account**

The email account (either Google or Outlook) that you subscribe to Flow with becomes your primary. 

We recommend that you use your personal Google or Outlook account as your primary, so that if you change jobs in the future, it's easy to disconnect your old work email and connect your new work email as a secondary account.

You only pay once for your primary account and can have as many secondary accounts as you'd like at no additional cost.

**Connect any secondary email accounts**

To add more secondary accounts, you can do so in the Settings (gear icon on the bottom left) \> General \> Linked Accounts. 

Click the "+ Link account" button and follow the Google or Outlook.

**Set your Inbox preferences**

Go to Settings \> Inbox and select the inboxes you want to display in the Inbox module. 

Also, set your default for composing new emails.

### Step 2: Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Install our GitHub app" icon="github">
    Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).

    Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Update your site name and colors" icon="palette">
    For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

    1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
    2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
    3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
    4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

    <Tip>
      Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference!

## Get started in three steps

Connect your accounts, set your preferences, and activate your Intelligent Inbox.

### Step 1: Connect your Google and Outlook accounts

**Connect your primary email account**

The email account (either Google or Outlook) that you use to subscribe to Flow on Stripe becomes your primary.

We recommend that you use your personal Google or Outlook account as your primary, so that if you change jobs, it's easy to disconnect your old work email and connect your new work email as a secondary account.

You only pay for your primary account and can have as many secondary accounts as you'd like at no additional cost.

**Connect your secondary email accounts**

To add secondary accounts, go to the Settings (gear icon on the bottom left) \> General \> Linked Accounts.

Click the "+ Link account" button and follow the Google or Outlook authentication.

### Step 2: Set your preferences

**Set your Inbox preferences**

Go to Settings \> Inbox and select the inboxes you want to display in the Inbox module.

Also, set your default for composing new emails.

**Set your Calendar preferences**

Go to Settings \> Calendar and select the calendars to display, the default for event creation, and the default for time blocking.

You can also set the color of your calendars using the overflow menu on the dropdown.

**Set your Time Blocking preferences**

Go to Settings \> Time Blocking and select your default availability, visibility, and event duration.

If co-workers have access to view your calendar, we recommend setting your visibility as Private so they won't be able to see the names of your time-blocked tasks on your calendar, but will still be able to see the rest of your normal events as usual.

### Step 3: Turn on your Intelligent Inbox

Go back to Settings \> Inbox and go down to the section called Intelligent Inbox.

Intelligent Inbox is a feature that uses AI to label emails, filter them based on priority, and enables the Briefings feature, allowing you to bulk process your emails.

By default, Intelligent Inbox is disabled, so you can individually select which accounts to enable it for.

**Set your auto-archiving preference**

There's a feature called Briefing preference in the Settings, which allows you to turn on and off "Archive non-important".

When the toggle is on, Flow will automatically archive any emails that are not considered important, saving them for your Briefing. This keeps your Inbox tidy and eliminates distractions.

When the toggle is off, Flow will only label them and not archive new emails.

<Info>
  Although the Briefing Schedule provides email reminders a few times a day, the actual Briefing view is always real-time. This means that, between reminders, you can always see and take action on all your new emails without waiting for the next reminder.

**Set your briefing schedule**

Set the days and times of the day when Flow will send you a reminder email that your briefing is ready. The goal is to bulk process your emails a few times a day rather than constantly being distracted by new emails that can wait.
